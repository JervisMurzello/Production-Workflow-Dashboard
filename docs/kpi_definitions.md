# KPI Definitions

- **Availability** = (Planned Time - Downtime) / Planned Time
- **Performance** = Actual Output / Theoretical Output at Ideal Cycle Time
- **Quality** = Good Units / Total Units
- **OEE** = Availability × Performance × Quality

- **Throughput (units/hour)** = Good Units / Runtime Hours
- **Cycle Time (sec/unit)** = Runtime Seconds / Units Produced
- **Defect Rate** = Defective Units / Total Units
- **MTBF** (Mean Time Between Failures) & **MTTR** (Mean Time To Repair) can be derived from downtime events.
